To use you need a GNU C++ compiler and doxygen for the documentation,
call "make all" and have a look at the documentation in the doxy
subdirectory.

Note that is mainly the result of a collection of students projects, 
and we are not able to guarantee support. Although we believe that most
modules are stable and efficiently implemented, there might be
differences in the quality of the code among different modules.

However, we are always happy to get informed about potential errors or
suggestions for improvement.
