mhlib is a collection of modules supporting the efficient and simple implementation 
of metaheuristics.

To use the library you need a GNU C++ compiler and doxygen for the documentation,
call "make all" and have a look at the documentation in the doxy
subdirectory. Under MS Windows, we recommend to use a more recent version of 
the mingw-w64 compiler, either in the 32 or 64 bit version, or the g++ compiler 
under the cygwin environment.

Note that this library is mainly the result of a collection of 
students projects, and we are not able to guarantee support. 
Although we believe that most modules are stable and efficiently implemented, 
there might be differences in the quality of the code among different modules.

However, we are always happy to get informed about applications,
potential errors or suggestions for improvement.
